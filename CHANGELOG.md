## Version 1.4.1 (October 23, 2025)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fixed: "Gönderme zamanını planla" Click Issue**
- **Problem**: Extension was getting stuck when clicking "Gönderme zamanını planla" (Schedule send)
- **Solution**: 
  - Added multiple fallback selectors (by attribute, by role, by text content)
  - Improved click simulation with focus + mouseover events
  - Added detailed logging for debugging
  - Increased wait times for dropdown and schedule dialog
- **Result**: More reliable clicking and dialog opening

**Enhanced Click Reliability**:
- Added `focus()` call before clicking
- Added `mouseover` event in addition to mouseenter
- Multiple click attempts for better success rate
- Better element visibility checking
- Logs element text and visibility state for debugging

**Increased Timing for Reliability**:
- `AFTER_COMPOSE_CLICK`: 300ms → 1200ms (Gmail needs time to load compose)
- `COMPOSE_WINDOW_READY`: 200ms → 400ms (Ensure compose is fully ready)
- `AFTER_DROPDOWN_CLICK`: 300ms → 800ms (Dropdown needs time to render)
- `BEFORE_MENU_SEARCH`: 300ms → 500ms (Menu items need time to appear)
- `BETWEEN_MOUSE_EVENTS`: 40ms → 50ms (Slightly more time between events)
- `AFTER_SCHEDULE_OPTION`: 400ms → 2000ms (Critical: schedule dialog needs time)
- `AFTER_DIALOG_READY`: 400ms → 500ms (Dialog elements need time to render)
- `AFTER_DATETIME_CLICK`: 500ms → 1500ms (Calendar needs time to appear)
- `AFTER_SAVE_CLICK`: 100ms → 1500ms (Schedule operation needs time)
- `AFTER_SCHEDULE_COMPLETE`: 100ms → 1500ms (Ensure scheduling is done)

### 🔧 Improvements

**Better Error Messages**:
- Logs all available menu items if "Gönderme zamanını planla" not found
- Shows element text content for verification
- Displays element visibility state
- Coordinates logged for click events

**More Resilient Selectors**:
1. First tries: `div[selector="scheduledSend"]`
2. Fallback: Search by text in `div[role="menuitem"]`
3. Last resort: `.J-N[selector="scheduledSend"]`

This ensures it works even if Gmail changes its structure slightly.
